Create training (67% of the data) and test (33%) data sets.

Fit a logistic regression classifier to the training data. 

Show the confusion matrix and accuracy for the training data and test data. 

Figure out whether exists overfitting problem?

Compute other performance metrics to assess the performance of classifier.

Improve the performance of your classifier by tring other models.
